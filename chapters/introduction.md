Several years back, I started working on writing a book. What the book was about -- a technical topic -- or how I planned to go about it -- without a plan -- really doesn't matter.  The important thing is, I never finished it. The primary reason I didn't finish the book, really, is because I realized I knew a lot of mechanics, but I really didn't know very much about communicating those mechanics to someone else.

Fast forward to today, I am starting again. This time, though mechanics are important, I am not particularly invested in how any one person decides they are going to solve a particular problem.  The possibilities are too numerous and it really doesn't matter on first approach anyway.  In all likelihood, something a developer writes today, they will hate a month from now.  This is the nature of programming -- it's not the programming that is hard, it's the learning.
